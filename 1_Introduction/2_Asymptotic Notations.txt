best ,worst ,and average cases

average cases are hard to calculate 
so take average of both best and worst(i think)

some algos have all the cases with same order of growth . 
Eg Merge sort ,min of array , max of array .

There are 3 notations we generally use:
Big O : exact bound or upper bound //if exact known is exact or ..
Theta : represents exact bound // in all cases same
Omega : represents exact or lower bound  // exact or lower bound ..
